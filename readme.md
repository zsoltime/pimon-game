# Day 13 of My 3 Weeks Game Challenge

I can't believe it's already the thirteenth day of my[challenge](https://github.com/zsoltime/game-challenge). Time flies when you're having fun. Pimon seemed to be like a good idea for today.

Pimon game is like [Simon Says][wiki] but instead of playing with a random sequence it follows the digits of the constant π.

You can simply click on _Start_ and Pimon will start flashing the digits of π, adding a new digit in each round. Once he finished, it's your turn to repeat π to as many decimals as Pimon did.

## User Stories

- [x] If I click the start button, it starts playing the sequence
- [x] While it's playing the sequence I can't press any button
- [x] Each time I press the buttons in the correct order, I see the same series with an additional digit of PI
- [x] If I press the wrong button, it notifies me and restarts the game

## Next Steps

Using a "soft mode" where you won't be instantly punished for pressing the wrong button might be a good idea. Adding another mode where you play against the clock seems to be also a great option.
